GAMEPAD SETUP

Until the Gamepad API is implemented in browsers, you'll need a
joystick -> keyboard mapper. The steps below get you set on Ubuntu.

1. Get utilties.
sudo apt-get install joystick joy2key

The configuration below works for my system.

-axis k i j l
-buttons a x w d z c q e

3. Start joy2key, and point it to the Chrome window
joy2key -config ddr
